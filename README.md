# Flight_Delay_Prediction

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning piipline to predict flight delays. This model will help traverls make informed descison when picking their flights. The project uses dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022/data).
